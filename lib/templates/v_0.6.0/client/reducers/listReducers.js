LIST REDUCERS GO HERE

//NOTES: eventually we'd like to remove the different reducers and just have a single __name__Reducer.
// with the maps, we can just find the "single" one by storing it's _id. create/update/delete also happen by the _id.
// we should also get rid of "populate" actions. instead of having to check if things are populated at ever turn,
// we can instead just check the _id of the item and the relevant map and request if it it's needed.
// finally, we can reduce server calls when moving between pages. if the map already has an entry for 
// _id == xx, and lastUpdated is less than a few minutes, don't fetch anything.
